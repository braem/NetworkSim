        Sprint 1: Right now, I need to keep track of:
            - what node the packet is at/is moving away from.
            - a packet-specific timer for connection delay.
        It makes no sense to store this information in the Network class.

        Sprint 2: Later on I'll also need to know if the packet is transmitting or propagating
        so I can tell what to do with it when the timer is up.
